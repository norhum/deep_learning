##Deep Learning Repository

Welcome to my deep learning repository! This is where I document and upload everything I've learned about deep learning, primarily using PyTorch. The repository is organized into folders categorized by year, making it easy to track my learning journey and progress over time.

#Each folder includes:

Code snippets and implementations.

Notes on deep learning concepts and techniques.

Exercises and experiments.

#Goals

To document my deep learning journey.

To consolidate my understanding of deep learning concepts through hands-on projects.

To provide a reference for myself and others interested in learning PyTorch and deep learning.

#Tools and Frameworks

This repository primarily uses:

Python: The main programming language for all implementations.

PyTorch: The deep learning framework of choice for building and experimenting with models.

#How to Navigate

Browse the folders to explore projects and notes organized by year.

Open individual project folders for detailed explanations, code, and resources.

Feel free to explore, learn, and adapt the code for your own projects.
