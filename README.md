# Deep Learning Repository

Welcome to my deep learning repository! This repository documents my learning journey in deep learning, primarily using PyTorch.  It's organized chronologically by year to track my progress.

## Contents

Each year's folder contains:

* **Code:** PyTorch code snippets, implementations of various models and techniques.
* **Notes:**  My personal notes on deep learning concepts, algorithms, and best practices.
* **Experiments:**  Results and analyses from experiments and exercises.


## Goals

* Document my deep learning learning journey.
* Consolidate my understanding through hands-on projects and experimentation.
* Provide a valuable resource for myself and others interested in learning PyTorch and deep learning.


## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **PyTorch:** The deep learning framework.
